Data Community DC Founded Datable as a way to provide career services to our members and sponsors. We were already assisting our members with their careers on an informal basis and we decided it was time to turn this assistance into an official part of DC2. Our first event will be held on May 31st, 2016. To find out how you can get involved, please email [Sean Gonzalez](mailto:seang@datacommunitydc.org) or [Dylan Hughes](mailto: dylan@datacommunitydc.org).
