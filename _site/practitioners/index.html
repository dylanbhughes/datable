<p>We’re excited to announce this new service to our members. To sign up for our Datable kickoff event on May 31st just swing by any Data Community DC event. For a complete list of events, please visit <a href="http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar">our calendar</a>.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the integrity of the event for both our practitioners and companies, we’re limiting these events to our members who regularly attend DC2 events. Once we grab your info at an event, we’ll send you a followup email with the invitation to Datable and you’ll be all set.</p>

<p>If you think you may be unable to make an event or wish to contribute to Datable in some other way, please reach out to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#100;&#121;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#100;&#097;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#111;&#109;&#109;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#100;&#099;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">Dylan Hughes</a>, our Event Introductions Associate.</p>
