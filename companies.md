Data Community DC is proud to unveil Datable, a new service that connects our members with companies looking to hire the best minds in Data Science.

With over 600 regular attendees, DC2 events are focal points for the top Data Scientists in the area. If you are interested in sponsoring Datable or DC2 we invite you to inspect our [offerings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L30gHhViYGdKYyIjINKlkb7aOp87286qBKBfgLM_HFA/edit?usp=sharing) and contact [Sean Gonzalez](mailto: seang@datacommunitydc.org) for further details.
